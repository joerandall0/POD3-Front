# Express Boilerplate 
Hello new padawan's and old Jedi's this is a simple boilerplate for init a project with:
+ Eslint Configured
+ EditorConfig
+ Basic .gitignore
+ Last feature of babel
+ Some npm tasks
+ .gitattributes for linux support files

# Npm tasks explanations
> ### Linter
> `npm run linter` this task is useful for indentify some error's and warn's what eslint give for us.
> ### Dev
> `npm run dev` this task up server in port `8080` always running before linter for check the code and after up a server with nodemon watching file changes.
> ### Start
> `npm run start` this is a default task for production, running a linter for check the code and transpile babel.

> ### Test
> `npm run test` not implemented yet, you can also send a pull request for this repo with teste feature, it would be great :).

# PS
